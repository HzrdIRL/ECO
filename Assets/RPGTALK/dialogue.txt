/* Welcome conversation

Terminal: Good morning.
Terminal: Please take your time getting up. You've been through a lot.
Terminal: ...
Terminal: Damaged systems include: Communications, Spring Pod, Summer Pod, Autumn Pod, Winter Pod.
Terminal: Thank goodness we still have the Spring core. Quick, pick it up [E] and get it to the Spring Pod controller over on the left.
Terminal: If you get stuck press [T] to use your communicator.
/* You've got the spring core, Make your first plant!
*
*/
Terminal: Great work! Now we can get cultivating.
Terminal: What? ... Why? Well to complete our mission of course. There must have been more damage to you than I thought. We have to get all 4 seasons completed and harvest their biomatter for complete biodiversity.
Terminal: Hopefully by then with enough biomatter we can get the communications operational to let Earth know the good news of ECO's success.
Terminal: To get out the cultivating tool, press [3]. To use the currently equipped tool press [space].
Terminal: The Spring Soil is on the ground to the left, Now that the core is in place you should be able to plant spring based fauna there. Try it now.

/* Planted!
*
*/
Terminal: Don't forget to water the plants daily or they may wither and die! 
Terminal: Simply get out your watering tool [1] and use it! [space]. You can retrieve more water into your backpack with the water reclaimer over on the left [E].
Terminal: It will take a few days before the plant is ready to harvest. You can pass time by using the bed to the right.

/* First Harvest!
*
*/
Terminal: Now that you've harvested your first crop, you can use it's biomatter to make more seeds and increase your yield. You can deposit the Biomatter you harvested into the BioMatterHub to the left using the cultivator.
Terminal: For now we only have Spring to plant in, but if you can find the other 3 cores we can acheive full biodiversity and plant in every pod.
Terminal: We will need to stockpile Biomatter and be able to cultivate from all 4 seasons to complete our mission.
Terminal: To keep track of your progress, see the panel on the wall behind the bed. Good luck!

/* Resources
*
*/
Terminal: In order to water more than Spring crops every day we will need new sources of water. We can only make 90 water per day via our pumps here at the base daily.
Terminal: There are a lot of ice deposits spread around the surface outside. If you use the harvester on them I am sure you'll be able to bring back enough water to sustain the other seasons.
Terminal: However the surface of Mars can be a harsh environment. Make sure your suit doesn't run out of fuel while you're outside, I'd have a hard time getting you back here.
Terminal: There are readings of possible hostile lifeforms in some areas. Use your harvester to scare them off or they might damage your suit. If you stay out too late you might get caught during the coldest time of night, I'll remind you to come home if it is approaching.

/* Summer core
*
*/
Terminal: Excellent, only 2 more seasons to go. Keep up the good work.

/* Autumn core
*
*/
Terminal: Only 1 more season left. Keep cultivating that land.

/* Winter core
*
*/
Terminal: Winter Core! The set is complete! Now we just need to harvest enough materials from all 4 seasons to complete our mission, you can see your progress on the panel behind the bed.

/* Insufficient materials
*
*/
Terminal: There is insufficient materials to withdraw at this time.

Terminal: Congratulations, mission success! Quick, lets contact Earth with the good news!
